# ARLONG MEDICAL RECORDS
    #### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/wCabxdRR_RA
    #### Description:
    This is my final project for "CS50 introduction to computer science with Python". I'm a recently graduated medical doctor and then I thought it would be cool if my program was a Medical Record System.
    It would also be easier for me to visualize how to build it by reverse engineering what I usually see. This programs does the following: 1) it stores valid patient data in a csv file and uses the cryptography library to encrypt and
    protect the patient medical records. The data will only be seen inside the program or when printing the medical records. 2) It automatically displays previous consults data in the respective field when you click on them so you can consult the
    patient clinical history and easily edit the fields if you are not seeing the patient for the first time. If you dont change anything, it prevents you from saving and warns that the consult already exists in the system. 3) You can delete consults if you must, just remember to save the corrected/edited version first. 4) You can print the patient whole medical record (all of his/her appointments), it produces a PDF that will automatically open and a csv file with the data (not sure what I would do with the csv yet, but
    i kept for future functionalities). Its named Arlong Medical Records because it was my first big challenge in coding and Arlong its the first big villain in one of my favorite stories "One Piece". The program has some flaws that can be improved like: It could be more versatile while accepting data formats like: %d-%m-%y,%d/%m/%Y, %d/%m/%y, %d%m%Y, %d%m%y. It could in some entry fields like: comorbidities, medications, allergies, family hx, surgeries, miscellaneous notes accept None argument. But I only thought about that today and
    I'm excited to move on and create more. I may come back to fix this in the future and build new functionalities. Thanks for the great course <3 THIS WAS CS50!
